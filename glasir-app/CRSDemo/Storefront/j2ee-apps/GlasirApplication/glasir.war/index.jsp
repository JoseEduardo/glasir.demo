    <p>For examples and demonstrations of applications, please refer to the other two web applications that have been deployed
    to this same location in the source tree.</p>
    <p>They are actually running! You can access them using the following links:</p>

    <p><a href="/crs">Commerce Reference Store</a></p>
    <h2>DCS Sample Cstalog</h2>
